# voluModel example
Developing an example notebook for the [IOOS CodeLab](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_code_lab) using the R package [voluModel](https://hannahlowens.github.io/voluModel/) to extrapolate environmental variables for the observed depth of the occurrence. This is meant to highlight how voluModel uses depth information to get a more accurate estimate of, for example, temperature data associated with an occurrence as opposed to using only sea surface or sea floor temperature variables. It will also highlight the proportion of data from the GBIF download that is IOOS-related, and it will pull temperature data from [World Ocean Atlas](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-atlas), which incorporates temperature data from the [IOOS Glider Data Assembly Center](https://gliders.ioos.us/). 

I am using GBIF data for the yellowtail snapper (*Ocyurus chrysurus*) to develop this notebook (for now). Data is available for download here: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.vwcmx2

MBON data was too large - even compressed - to be included in the Git repo. You can download up-to-date data for U.S. MBON here: https://mapper.obis.org/?instituteid=23070 The version used in this repository was downloaded on 9 July 2024.
